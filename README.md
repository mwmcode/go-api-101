If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can click the badge above or [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/go-postgres) to get started. Clicking these links will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

[VSCode Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container)


- Run `go run main.go`
- Open `api.http` (_using VSCode Rest Client extention which is already included in this DevContainer)
